Getting started
===============

This is where you describe how to get set up on a clean install, including the
commands necessary to get the raw data (using the `sync_data_from_s3` command,
for example), and then how to make the cleaned, final data sets.

```py title="add_numbers.py linenums=1"
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2)
```
